# Internet Engineering Front Final Project

This repository contains the files for my final project for the Internet Engineering course at Amirkabir University of Technology.

## Contents
- `index.html`: the main file for the project, containing the HTML structure and content
- `style.css`: the stylesheet for the project, defining the visual appearance of the page

## Description
The aim of the project is to create a simple, functional website using HTML and CSS. The website consists of a single page that provides information about the course and the project, including:
- An overview of the Internet Engineering course
- The purpose and goals of the project
- Details about the files contained in the repository

## Usage
To view the website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The styles are applied via the `style.css` file. Note that the website is designed to be used on desktop and laptop devices, and may not display correctly on smaller screens such as smartphones or tablets.

## Limitations
The current version of the website is a basic prototype, and as such there may be limitations in terms of functionality, design, and accessibility. Some possible areas for improvement in future versions include:
- Adding more pages or sections to the website
- Incorporating responsive design to ensure optimal display on different devices and screen sizes
- Improving accessibility for users with disabilities

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to the development of the website, please open a new issue or pull request on the repository's GitHub page. Any suggestions, feedback, or bug reports are also welcome.
